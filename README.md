### Ion trap demo
A classical demo to visualize how an individual atom can be "trapped" for experimental study. It's been designed to use as many 3D printed parts as possible or just inexpensive parts easily ordered online.

The physics of how an individual atom can be "trapped" in a vacuum for experimental study is fascinating. It's also led to a few Noble prizes and dramatically advanced the fields of atomic, optical, and molecular physics as well as quantum information. This ion trap demo is a simple analogy for how individual atoms are actually trapped in a [linear Paul trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_trap#Linear_Paul_Trap). In a "real" ion trap, the atom would first be ionized by a laser or two, then held in place by electrodes at static and oscillating voltages. In this demo, we use gravity and a rotating saddle shape to simulate the oscillating voltage part of the linear Paul trap.
