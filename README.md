### [How to trap an atom](https://github.com/ajrazander/hardware/tree/main/ion-trap-demo)
This physics demo shows how an individual atom can be "trapped" for experimental study using an [Paul trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer#Paul_trap). State-of-the-art Paul traps are used for [trapped-ion quantum computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer) and [mass spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_ion_trap). The demo was designed to use as many 3D printed parts as possible and inexpensive parts for the rest.

The physics of how an *individual* atom can be "trapped" in a vacuum for experimental study is fascinating. It's also led to a few Noble prizes and dramatically advanced the fields of [atomic, optical, and molecular physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics) as well as [quantum information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information). This ion trap demo is a simple analogy for how individual atoms are actually trapped in a [linear Paul trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_trap#Linear_Paul_Trap).

In Paul traps used for quantum computing, the atom would first be ionized by a laser (or two) at the center of the Paul trap. The atom then has a net positive charge, so we call it an ion. The ion's net charge is pushed by the voltages on the Paul trap's electrodes in such a way that the ion can't escape--hence the ion is "trappped". How the electrode voltages can push on the ion is actually quite limited (see [Earnshaw's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnshaw%27s_theorem)). To get around this limitation, Paul trap electrodes have oscillating (colloquially refered to as rf) voltages and static voltages. *We'll just focus on the oscillating voltages in this demo.* The oscillating voltages make a saddle like shape, but why doesn't the ion just fall off the sides of the saddle and escape? This demo shows how. Gravity and the rotating saddle simulate how the oscillating voltages in a linear Paul trap can trap an ion.

This paper and lab demo [1] was quite helpful, and it gives a great practical and theoretical review of how this demo relates to a real linear Paul trap.
