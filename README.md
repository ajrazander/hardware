### How to catch an atom
This physics demo shows how an individual atom can be "trapped" for experimental study using an [Paul trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer#Paul_trap). Paul traps can be used for [trapped-ion quantum computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer) and [mass spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_ion_trap). The demo has been designed to use as many 3D printed parts as possible or just inexpensive parts easily ordered online.

The physics of how an *individual* atom can be "trapped" in a vacuum for experimental study is fascinating. It's also led to a few Noble prizes and dramatically advanced the fields of [atomic, optical, and molecular physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics) as well as [quantum information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information). This ion trap demo is a simple analogy for how individual atoms are actually trapped in a [linear Paul trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_trap#Linear_Paul_Trap).

In Paul traps used for quantum computing, the atom would first be ionized by a laser (or two) at the center of the Paul trap. The ion's charge is pushed by the Paul trap's electrodes such that the ion can't escape--hence the ion is "trappped". The Paul trap electrodes use a combination of static and oscillating (aka rf) voltages to trap the ion. In this demo, gravity and the rotating saddle simulate the oscillating voltage part of the linear Paul trap.

This paper and lab demo [1] was quite helpful and gives a great practical and theoretical review of how this demo relates to a real linear Paul trap.
