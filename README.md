This physics demo shows how an individual atom can be "trapped" for experimental study using an [Paul trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer#Paul_trap). State-of-the-art Paul traps are used for [trapped-ion quantum computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer) and [mass spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_ion_trap). The demo was designed to use as many 3D printed parts as possible and inexpensive parts for the rest.

### Instructions
[Read the build instructions](https://github.com/ajrazander/hardware/blob/main/ion-trap-demo/README.md#build-instructions) for how to assemble the pieces together including some pictures and videos of it working.

### Experiments
Coming...

Hold a quantum bit---[a qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit)---in your hands and recreate modern experiments with this fully 3D printable [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere) and qubit state vector.

### Instructions
