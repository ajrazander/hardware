# The Trapped Ion
Here's a ping pong ball demonstrating how atomic physicists trap individual atoms for study.

### Designs
The designs folder holds the 3D printed components:
1. The saddle which sits on top of the motor shaft.
2. The box that holds all the components together

### Literature
Contains papers I found useful when designing this project as well as the physics this demo is demonstrating.

### Pictures
Pictures of different parts and how they fit together.

Saddle design. The saddle shape can be redesigned and calculated to your liking by using the "saddle-design.nb" notebook. Mathematica allows for a simple equation to stl file export.

Parts list. Lists each part and where I purchased them (if you find something cheaper let me know).
* Box. A 3D printed container to hold everything together (see designs/box.stl)
* Saddle. A 3D printed saddle that "traps" the ping pong ball (see designs/saddle_100xy_50z.stl).
* 12V DC motor (probably want it it geared down to a few hundred RPM). Used to spin the saddle. Review the paper under the literature folder to calculate how much speed you may want. 1Hz (60 RPM) seems to be a golden speed for most saddles. I purchased one [online for $15](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072R5G5GR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) that's probably too beefy but I like the standing geometry (Jan 2023).
* 12V DC motor speed controller. You could make this yourself if you have access to a basic eletronics shop. I purchased [these online for $10](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HQQR3FQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (Jan 2023)
* 8 AA battery holder. Used to power the DC motor. I bought it [here for $7](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WP1CYYW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (Jan 2023)
* 8 AA batteries.
* Ping pong ball. The ping pong ball is the "atom" in the trap. I used a standard 40mm size ping pong ball and [purchased a few here for $10](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V57KP1G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)
