# The Trapped Ion
Here's a pingpong ball demonstrating how atomic physicists trap individual atoms for study.

### Designs
The designs folder holds the 3D printed components:
1. The saddle which sits on top of the motor shaft.
2. The box that holds all the components together

### Literature
Contains papers I found useful when designing this project as well as the physics this demo is demonstrating.

### Pictures
Pictures of different parts and how they fit together.

Saddle design. The saddle shape can be redesigned and calculated to your liking by using the "saddle-design.nb" notebook. Mathematica allows for a simple equation to stl file export.

Parts list. Lists each part and where I purchased them (if you find something cheaper let me know).
