# The Bloch Sphere
The [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere) is a visual representation of a two-level quantum system---aka a [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit). In experiments, qubits do not physically look like the Bloch sphere, but the Bloch sphere can describe the dynamics of a single qubit. Here, you'll have a hands-on learning experience to learn the quantum physics behind qubits, and various techniques used in modern day experiments.

# Build Instructions

### Parts list
* Bloch sphere. A 3D printed Bloch sphere where the qubit vector can glide along set rails. (see designs/bloch_sphere.stl). (June 2024)
* Qubit vector. A 3D printed qubit vector that glides along the Bloch sphere rails. (see designs/qubit_vector.stl) (June 2024)

### Designs
The designs folder holds the 3D printed components which you will need to print:
1. The Bloch sphere. Print with supports.
2. The qubit vector. Printable without supports.

### Assembly

1. Print Bloch sphere (requires supports). Remove support material. Consider sanding where supports were.

2. Print qubit vector.

3. Slip qubit vector into Bloch sphere rails. It’s easiest at an intersection.

### Noncommuting quantum operations
Rubik's cube demonstration. The cube is rotated two different directions. Depending on the order, the yellow side ends up in a different location.

Bloch sphere demonstration. The vector is rotated two different directions. Depending on the order, the vector ends up in a different location. This is an example of how the order of quantum operations also matter.
