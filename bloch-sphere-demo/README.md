# The Bloch Sphere
The [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere) is a visual representation of a two-level quantum system---aka a [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit). In experiments, qubits do not physically look like the Bloch sphere, but the Bloch sphere can describe the dynamics of a single qubit. Here, you'll have a hands-on learning experience to learn the quantum physics behind qubits, and various techniques used in modern day experiments.

### Parts list
* Bloch sphere. A 3D printed Bloch sphere where the qubit vector can glide along set rails. (see designs/bloch_sphere.stl). (June 2024)
* Qubit vector. A 3D printed qubit vector that glides along the Bloch sphere rails. (see designs/qubit_vector.stl) (June 2024)

### Designs
The designs folder holds the 3D printed components which you will need to print:
1. The Bloch sphere. Print with supports.
2. The qubit vector. Printable without supports.

# Instructions

### Assembly

1. Print Bloch sphere. Remove support material. Consider sanding where supports were.

2. Print qubit vector.

3. Slip qubit vector into Bloch sphere rails. It’s easiest at an intersection.
